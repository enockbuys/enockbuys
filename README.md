## 🎯 About Me

I am an Honours student at the **University of Johannesburg** specializing in **Artificial Intelligence**. My research and projects are focused on the practical application of advanced ML techniques, including **Generative AI** and **Reinforcement Learning**, to solve complex problems like financial fraud detection and strategic game playing.

I am concurrently honing my industry skills through the **ALX Data Science Bootcamp**, building robust end-to-end data solutions. I am passionate about the entire ML pipeline—from data preprocessing and model development to deployment and MLOps.
